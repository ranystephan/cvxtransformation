# Portfolio Transformation Framework

This repository focuses on **portfolio transformation strategies**â€”techniques for efficiently transitioning from one portfolio composition to another over time.

The backtesting framework is adapted from [cvxgrp/markowitz-reference](https://github.com/cvxgrp/markowitz-reference).

## Overview

Portfolio transformation addresses the practical challenge of changing portfolio allocations while minimizing transaction costs and market impact. This framework implements and compares different transformation strategies.

## Data

The main dataset is in `data_ranycs/` and contains:

- **Prices** (`prices_full.csv`): 235 assets over 2,502 trading days (July 2015 - June 2025)
- **Bid-Ask Spreads** (`spreads_full.csv`): Transaction cost data for all assets
- **Volume** (`volumes_shares_full.csv`): Trading volume data
- **Risk-Free Rate** (`rf.csv`): Daily risk-free rates
- **Short Fees** (`shortfees_full.csv`): Cost of shorting data

All data has been cleaned and aligned across the same time period and asset universe.

## Experiments

The `experiments/` directory contains the core simulation logic, organized into four main components:
- `backtest.py`: The simulation engine that runs trading strategies over historical data.
- `portfolio_construction.py`: Defines methods for creating portfolios, such as minimum variance or equal weight.
- `transformation_strategies.py`: Implements the algorithms for transitioning a portfolio from a starting to a target allocation.
- `test_scenarios.py`: Orchestrates specific experiments, combining the other components to simulate and analyze outcomes.
